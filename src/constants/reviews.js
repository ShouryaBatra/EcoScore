    "I recently purchased the LONDON FOG Baby Boys' Raincoat, and I couldn't be happier with it. The coat is not only adorable but also very functional. The material is high quality, providing excellent protection against rain while still being lightweight and comfortable for my little one. The fit is perfect, allowing room for layering without being too bulky. I also appreciate the attention to detail, like the secure snaps and the cozy lining that keeps my baby warm on chilly, wet days. This raincoat is a great blend of style and practicality, and I highly recommend it for any parent looking to keep their child dry and comfortable.": 0.894,

    "We live in the Pacific NW and bought the jacket at the end of spring. The weight is perfect. The fit is oversized so he can wear a sweater under it on cool days. It should still fit him in the fall (we hope) It was waterproof in the rain and kept him dry. The zipper and lining are quality. We LOVE the color and design.": 0.894,
